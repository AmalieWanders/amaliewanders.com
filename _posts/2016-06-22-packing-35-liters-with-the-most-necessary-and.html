In fact, so challenging that some of the things were stuffed into the sleeves of the raincoat, buckled up around the bag, and put in Converse trainers (mum’s boyfriend sure knows some packing hacks that came in handy). <br/></p><p>Of course, a couple of months before my trip, I armed myself with some useful packing information, especially meant for travelers to Costa Rica, Central, and South America:<br/><a href="http://www.whereverwriter.com/south-america-packing-list/">http://www.whereverwriter.com/south-america-packing-list/</a><br/><a href="http://herpackinglist.com/2013/02/female-packing-list-to-costa-rica/">http://herpackinglist.com/2013/02/female-packing-list-to-costa-rica/</a><br/><a href="http://mytanfeet.com/costa-rica-travel-tips/packing-for-rainy-season-in-costa-rica/">http://mytanfeet.com/costa-rica-travel-tips/packing-for-rainy-season-in-costa-rica/</a><br/>and much more… <br/></p><p>I wanted to have a 20 kg check-in luggage and a carry-on. But, considering the fact that I really hate dealing with lots of bags and taking into account a great deal of good advice, I decided to travel as lightly as possible.<br/></p><p>My list kinda followed most of the suggestions from the links above and kinda didn’t because amphibian zip-off shoes cost a fortune. And I simply don’t like any of the long sleeved shirts that I own. Some items seemed more important than the others, and having more items just wouldn’t match my “traveling lightly” philosophy. I also tried to pack the stuff that I really like. <br/>And here is my list of things:</p>

<p>Technology:</p>

<p>- phone<br/>- laptop<br/>- camera<br/>+ all of these items have chargers.</p>

<p>Toiletries:</p>

<p>- toothbrush and toothpaste<br/>- deodorant <br/>- nail clippers, files, and manicure scissors <br/>- wet wipes<br/>- cotton pads and tampons<br/>- 2 types of multipurpose cream<br/>- facial cream <br/>- sunscreen<br/>- hair dye<br/>- mascara<br/>- microfiber towel</p>

<p>(In case you&rsquo;re wondering, how did I get all of those liquids into a 1-liter bag, some of the packages were half empty)</p>

<p>Clothes:</p>

<p>- 2 regular bras, 2 sports bras<br/>- 7 undies<br/>- 2 sets of bikini, a rash guard<br/>- 4 pairs of socks<br/>- 2 pairs of leggings<br/>- running shorts <br/>- zip-off trousers with a belt (they’re simply cheaper than zip-off shoes, and also they have more ways of use) <br/>- jeans<br/>- yoga pants<br/>- skirt<br/>- 3 t-shirts<br/>- 3 tank tops, a crop-top<br/>- 2 tube tops (can be used as a skirt) <br/>- a very long and thin cotton scarf <br/>- 2 dresses<br/>- sweater<br/>- jacket<br/>- raincoat</p>

<p>Shoes:</p>

<p>- sandals<br/>- trainers<br/>- hiking shoes</p>

<p>Other things:</p>

<p>- medicine<br/>- travel documents<br/>- head-lamp<br/>- duct tape<br/>- rubber sink stopper<br/>- sewing kit<br/>- accessories <br/>- wreck-this-journal pocket version (for taking notes)</p>

<p>Some of the items on the list such as zip-off trousers, tube tops, a scarf, leggings, and a towel I consider to be multipurpose. Other items probably won’t be used that often. But I made sure that I really take a smaller version of my stuff. So I could feel comfy at any time. So I could take it and store it anywhere. So I could find a place for my stuff everywhere I go.</p>

<p>Honestly, I wish I could have taken less but then again I didn’t want to leave some of my precious stuff at home. <br/>Stuff sure does create lots of problems, many have concluded this. Be considerate about stuff you need, especially when you’re going on a trip far, far away. Meanwhile, I’m going to enjoy some snacks that I’ve stored away in my trainers.</p>
