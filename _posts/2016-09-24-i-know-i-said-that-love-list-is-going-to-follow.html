Oh,  well. Love comes slowly and lists too. Forgive me my damn procrastination because that&rsquo;s one of my favourite things to do. Photos. Not too many this time.</p><p>I absolutely love:</p><p>Weather - In Costa Rica, only two seasons exist - rainy (May - December) and dry (January -  April). I came here when the rainy season had already begun. They also call it winter,  but for me, it still seems like summer due to the temperatures that range from 25 - 30°C. Sometimes it gets really hot,  sometimes it&rsquo;s quite thunderstormy and rains buckets, but I enjoy it anyway.</p><p>Mountains - Costa Rica certainly is not flat, mountainous sceneries can be seen almost everywhere, and from afar they look like mysterious crooked blue whales merging one into another.</p><p>Playas - So far I have visited only the Pacific Coast beaches. Palm trees,  surfers, water as warm as milk, granizado. I&rsquo;m still scared of the ocean,  though.</p><p>Granizado - a cold dessert made from shavings of ice mixed with a sugary syrup (either from fruits or berries), powdered milk, laced with condensed milk. It&rsquo;s a sugar bomb. Its bright colours make me think of unicorns and rainbows.</p><p>Diminutives - Costa Ricans use diminutives in Spanish a lot. Actually, they’ve been known for using diminutives so excessively that they have earned a lovely nickname for their nationality - Ticos. For example, “un momento” can be said as “un momentito” or even in a more distinctive manner for Ticos “un momentico”. The use of diminutives makes Costa Rican everyday speech sound as laced with sugar and super cute. </p><p>Churros - It’s a fried-dough pastry snack filled with caramelized condensed milk. Super sweet and greasy. Another calory bomb next to granizado.</p><p>Chillaxed attitude - Everything happens annoyingly slowly and some people just don&rsquo;t care about it. They just keep calm and don&rsquo;t make a fuss about things they can&rsquo;t affect. It&rsquo;s so sticky that I didn&rsquo;t give a damn about BACSanJosé not being able to open my account for a month. I just kept being patient with the bank and went to it weekly to make sure they&rsquo;re working on the problem they had with my account.</p><p>3 months have passed since I left my home country. No matter how much I miss Latvia, my dear family and friends, I still want to stay a little longer in Costa Rica and enjoy the small things, learn and improve my Spanish skills, just be here.</p>
