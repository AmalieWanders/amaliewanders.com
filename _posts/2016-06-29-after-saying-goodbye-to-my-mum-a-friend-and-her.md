After saying goodbye to my mum, a friend,  and her daughter at the airport in Riga, after going through 4 securities,  after having 3 meals and lots of sweet snacks (the same ones that I had kept in my trainers), after not being able to sleep on the plane because it was too cold,  because there were babies crying and the noise of the air conditioner,  after listening to Simon and Garfunkel,  Patti Smith,  and Jimi Hendrix,  after talking to really awesome people,  after having a feet massage, after meeting a prospective Workaway host in Nicaragua, after going through migration area,  after spending 21 hours on my way I went out of the airport around 4.30 a.m. and felt really confused because neither I had the address or the phone number of my Workaway host saved on my phone,  nor I knew which public bus might take me to the right place.I decided to take a taxi and went with the shadiest looking taxi driver - a bald, fat man with a potato nose planted in the middle of his face,  shiny, thick lips and a sly look. Besides he didn’t know where the hostel was,  so he chose to go with his gut feeling and we ended up in the wrong place. After making a few phone calls and talking with other taxi drivers, we finally reached Nomadas Backpackers, the hostel.It was 5 a.m. I rang the bell near the gate, and a woman came up to the window, it was my host’s wife Magdalena, she let me in and told me that her husband had forgotten about my arrival (oh, well, somehow that didn’t surprise me). She asked me about the flight and then guided me to the dorm room. As soon as I wrapped myself in the blanket, I dozed off…P.S. First impression’s scraps coming soon.
