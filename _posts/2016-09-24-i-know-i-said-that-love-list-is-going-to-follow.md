Playa Puerto CalderaGranizadoChurrosI know I said that “Love List” is going to follow soon. Oh,  well. Love comes slowly and lists too. Forgive me my damn procrastination because that’s one of my favourite things to do. Photos. Not too many this time.I absolutely love:Weather - In Costa Rica, only two seasons exist - rainy (May - December) and dry (January -  April). I came here when the rainy season had already begun. They also call it winter,  but for me, it still seems like summer due to the temperatures that range from 25 - 30°C. Sometimes it gets really hot,  sometimes it’s quite thunderstormy and rains buckets, but I enjoy it anyway.Mountains - Costa Rica certainly is not flat, mountainous sceneries can be seen almost everywhere, and from afar they look like mysterious crooked blue whales merging one into another.Playas - So far I have visited only the Pacific Coast beaches. Palm trees,  surfers, water as warm as milk, granizado. I’m still scared of the ocean,  though.Granizado - a cold dessert made from shavings of ice mixed with a sugary syrup (either from fruits or berries), powdered milk, laced with condensed milk. It’s a sugar bomb. Its bright colours make me think of unicorns and rainbows.Diminutives - Costa Ricans use diminutives in Spanish a lot. Actually, they’ve been known for using diminutives so excessively that they have earned a lovely nickname for their nationality - Ticos. For example, “un momento” can be said as “un momentito” or even in a more distinctive manner for Ticos “un momentico”. The use of diminutives makes Costa Rican everyday speech sound as laced with sugar and super cute. Churros - It’s a fried-dough pastry snack filled with caramelized condensed milk. Super sweet and greasy. Another calory bomb next to granizado.Chillaxed attitude - Everything happens annoyingly slowly and some people just don’t care about it. They just keep calm and don’t make a fuss about things they can’t affect. It’s so sticky that I didn’t give a damn about BACSanJosé not being able to open my account for a month. I just kept being patient with the bank and went to it weekly to make sure they’re working on the problem they had with my account.3 months have passed since I left my home country. No matter how much I miss Latvia, my dear family and friends, I still want to stay a little longer in Costa Rica and enjoy the small things, learn and improve my Spanish skills, just be here.
