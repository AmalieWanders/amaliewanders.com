Museo de Arte CostarricenseBerta by Juan Manuel Sanchez BarrantesBestia con acrobata by Sila Chanto QuesadaLa Agricultura, mural by Francisco Amighetti RuizPantalones crian fama by Guilbert Laporte SatoConflicto entre gato y niño by Francisco Amightetti RuizSalon Dorado (Golden Room)A scene of mural by French artist Louis Feron Parizot in Salon Dorado (Golden Room)Costa Rican Art Museum (Museo de Arte Costarricense, La Sabana Park), formerly the main building of San Jose’s first international airport, contains a large and impressive collection of Costa Rican visual artworks dating back to colonial times. Most of the art pieces on display are sculptures and paintings. I was surprised that one of the exhibits consisted only of the sculptures of the artist Juan Manuel Sanchez Barrantes’s muse Berta. I guess it’s love. For the first time in my life, I had a chance to see murals - large format paintings carrying social or political messages, an important characteristic of art in las Americas. The best thing - the museum is for free.
