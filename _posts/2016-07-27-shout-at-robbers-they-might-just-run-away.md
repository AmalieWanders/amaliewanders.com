We were sitting in La Sabana Metropolitan park (not the best idea when it’s dark there) when three teenagers approached us and one of them ordered me twice in Spanish to give him my phone (yeah, dude, right away, especially, I’m so going to give away my valuables when someone is ordering me to do it in a soft voice). As he was leaning closer towards me, I got up quickly and started shouting at him hysterically that I was not giving him my phone. They just ran away. I don’t know what would I’ve done if they would have had a knife or a gun. I might not resist or I might. Some people here don’t even resist if a robber obviously isn’t armed. And I think it’s wrong. If you have an opportunity to resist, always do.
