Gabriel and his wife are lovely, they seem super chilled out about everything, and that chilled out attitude has been quite infectious. Actually, all people here seem relaxed and slow, except the cars and their drivers - the traffic here is crazy, speeding in San Jose seems to be a common thing. Besides, I still have no clue how to cross streets properly here because crossings are far away from each other and people mostly cross the streets in whatever places they need. And I’m just mostly doing the same now.On my first day here I got CR number, exchanged dollars to Costa Rican colons and went to the closest supermarket to the place I’m staying at and apparently also the most expensive.Once again I understood that I have a really bad memory or it’s just the local people telling me things in a way that I can’t remember them. My host was explaining to me how to get to the telephone operating company ICE – go straight, after 25 meters turn right, go for another 20 meters and turn left, then turn right and go for 100 meters (something like that). On my way out of the house I had forgotten everything, so I decided to practice my Spanish and ask for the way to other Ticos. Their directions were almost the same, only the distance varied a little. Other than that, people seem friendly and helpful here.On my first day, I also found out that my magical travel plug/ adapter that I bought in Latvia doesn’t work with the cable of my laptop. It worked with my mobile phone’s cable though. And this is where the chilled out attitude set in. I really tried my best to worry and find information about the problem I had but all of the possibilities – overcharged battery, broken cable etc. - just couldn’t make me worry. I continued being relaxed.On the second day, I wanted to withdraw some cash but the ATM I found wasn’t accepting my card,  another one just swallowed it after I typed in my pin code incorrectly for several times. Although I had selected the English language for the ATM, I was totally lost in translation and meanings of words. It just seemed totally normal that in a foreign country ATM could ask for my personal identification number. Oh, well, things like these happen. Should have tried my pin code instead of typing an 11 digit long personal identity number.  But I got my card back in no time.People here are genuinely helpful. At least that’s what I want to believe in.
