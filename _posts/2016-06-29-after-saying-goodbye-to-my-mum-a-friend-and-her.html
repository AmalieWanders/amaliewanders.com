Besides he didn&rsquo;t know where the hostel was,  so he chose to go with his gut feeling and we ended up in the wrong place. After making a few phone calls and talking with other taxi drivers, we finally reached Nomadas Backpackers, the hostel.</p><p>It was 5 a.m. I rang the bell near the gate, and a woman came up to the window, it was my host&rsquo;s wife Magdalena, she let me in and told me that her husband had forgotten about my arrival (oh, well, somehow that didn&rsquo;t surprise me). She asked me about the flight and then guided me to the dorm room. As soon as I wrapped myself in the blanket, I dozed off&hellip;</p><p>P.S. First impression’s scraps coming soon.</p>
