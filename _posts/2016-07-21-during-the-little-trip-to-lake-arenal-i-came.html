It’s an inspiring gem hiding in the uphill surrounded by trees. It took him three years to build his home, and it’s still not finished. In the interior of the house, Juan has playfully used bottles, tires, pieces of tiles and wood. His house definitely is an excellent example of a sustainable house due to the way he has constructed it and the creative play of materials combined in its construction. Moreover, Juan and his wife also have used the land around the house for growing plants - mostly vegetables and herbs to sustain themselves with food. I’ve always thought that this kind of lifestyle is worth aspiring to.</p><p>Follow the link to see more of Juan Carlos Ruiz Soto&rsquo;s art  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/juancarlosruizestudio/?__mref=message_bubble">https://www.facebook.com/juancarlosruizestudio/?__mref=message_bubble</a></p>
