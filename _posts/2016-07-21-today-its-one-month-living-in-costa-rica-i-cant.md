Lake ArenalLake ArenalLake ArenalToday it’s one month living in Costa Rica. I can’t believe that time has passed so quickly. I’ve met a lot of nice people here - locals, tourists, and travelers who enjoy places at a slower pace. I’ve done a lot of unhealthy snacking and procrastinating here. A tiny bit of freelance writing for a friend. Tasting local fruits and food. Walking in mountains. Sleeping. Watching documentaries and TED talks. Playing sudoku. Writing cover letters and translating a resume in Spanish. Sending them. Learning Spanish. Speaking Spanish on buses with strangers. Thinking in English. Chit-chatting and serious talking in Latvian with friends and family back home. Doing online courses. Listening to birds and trying to spot squirrels in La Sabana Metropolitan park. I haven’t visited a lot of places, I’ve mostly been doing my Workaway in San Jose, helping with the maintenance of the hostel for a couple of hours a day.More than a week ago I went to Tilaran, lake Arenal. Spent three slow, peaceful, and wonderful days there. Having tortillas con natilla (sour cream) for breakfast every day definitely is not healthy, but they are so great, especially, when homemade. Wild mangos are incredibly tasty, only have to be careful when picking them - sometimes there can be annoyed howler monkeys around, looking and shouting at you like you’re stealing an ice-cream from them. Enjoyed a little bit of nakedness and swimming in the lake, didn’t take a lot of photos. A tiny scrap of information on the lake - it’s the largest lake in Costa Rica with the area of 85-square-kilometre. It was expanded triple it’s size in 1979 when Arenal dam was constructed. It’s considered to be one of the best places in the world for windsurfing and kite surfing. What else about my month and further plans in Costa Rica?Chilling a lot. Enjoying it as slowly as possible. Moving away from the noises of San Jose soon.
