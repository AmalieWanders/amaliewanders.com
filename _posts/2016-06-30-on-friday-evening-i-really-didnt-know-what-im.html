And then I met an angel Anhel who had come from Madrid to Costa Rica for a vacation and was staying in Nomadas Backpackers. He’s head over heels into surfing and his future plans involve moving to Costa Rica after retiring from work. When he offered me to join his trip to the Pacific coast, to Jaco, on Saturday morning, I agreed almost immediately. My weekend was saved from the boredom.</p><p>Costa Rica is quite a mountainous country, so the road went up and down. And through some cliffs as well. And over a river with a bunch of lazy crocodiles sunbathing on the riverbank. The sceneries on the way to the Pacific coast were stunning – valleys, mountains, and forests.</p><p>Anhel had heard of a private beach called Punta Leona, a good place for surfing but as he couldn’t find a way how to access it, we went to other ones – Playa Mantas and Playa Blanca. It was my first time near the ocean. I was amazed by the warm water, the sand, the corals washed ashore, and the palm trees. It just felt like a tiny paradise. After a little walk, we continued our way to Jaco because we needed to find a cheap place to stay overnight.</p><p>Room 2 Board appeared to be quite a lively place like a 30-second walk away from the beach with a frothing water. This beach was completely different from the previous ones – it was muddy, with some trash lying around but, still, the palm trees gave an idyllic mood to the place, as well as the couples sitting near the ocean, people walking dogs, and the surfers riding waves.  </p><p>I tried my best to swim but it probably didn’t look like it. The currents seemed too strong for swimming, so I just went out of the water after a couple of minutes despite its warm temperature. The next morning, I tried swimming again but as the currents were even stronger and waves even bigger I just ended up tasting ocean water. It was so salty that I’m pretty sure now – the sea water is drinkable. </p><p>Salud!</p>
