<p>As I was standing completely soaked under an old tree trying to hide from the thunderstorm that was raging around, I remembered about Roy Sullivan, a park ranger from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, US, who had been struck by lightning 7 times during his lifetime and survived. He ended up shooting himself because of an unrequited love towards his younger wife. What a cowardly act it is to commit suicide out of a feeling that you aren’t loved. But what if that is the only way to stop the black heavy clouds and the thunder from growing thicker and bigger in your chest? Love can be painful and blinding and suffocating. You gag for a tiny sip of air, you want to push it away, but it leaves soaring marks that get infected again as you look through the photos taken together when everything was covered in a pink veil. </p>
