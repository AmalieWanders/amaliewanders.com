Hello! 
I’m Baiba Vītola aka Amalie Wanders, an English teacher, and a dreamer. I believe that it is possible to achieve anything unless you are giving into laziness, procrastination, and blocking yourself with doubts. 

So, here I am, stepping out of my cozy, warm comfort zone. Battling laziness, wandering, exploring, experiencing, learning, writing about all of those things, and teaching English.
