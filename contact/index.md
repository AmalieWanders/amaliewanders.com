**Teaching English**

Language learning can be tough unless you have a positive and energetic teacher who can explain challenging and difficult topics in an entertaining and easy way and provide loads of practice.

During my teaching practice, including private tutoring, I have taught English not only to children, but also - to teens, and adults.

Whether in person or online, I want to help my students meet their language learning goals, improve their skills, stay motivated and become more fluent speakers. Fluency in spoken English is the key to success, new opportunities, connections, and adventures. 

**Freelance Writing**

During my Bachelor and Master studies, I mastered academic writing and qualitative research on topics related to English literature, text analysis, education, and language learning.

As a freelance writer, my specialty is creating entertaining, and informative articles, as well as creative content. I ghostwrite or write under a pseudonym. 

**Translations (LV - ENG, ENG - LV)**

You can also hire me as a translator. I have experience in translating legal texts and documents, informative and academic materials. 

**Photo Use**
